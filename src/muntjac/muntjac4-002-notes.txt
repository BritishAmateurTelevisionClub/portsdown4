muntjac4-002-notes
==================

muntjac4-0v1c.uf2 and muntjacsdr_dvb-0v2j.c remove the power limit of 15.
The PD power correction has been removed.
A bug affecting the LO parameters for power 15 has been corrected. (Maybe).

mjcalib-0v1a.c enables the manual manipulation of the LO suppression parameters.
Use the keys described to change power, iloc and qloc.
The setting does not change much over each group of 4 power settings,
so only extra settings for powers 16, 20, 24 and 28 need to be added to the .mjo file manually.
If a power setting is not found in the .mjo file by muntjacsdr_dvb, (power & ~3) is searched for.
Use 440 and 2400 in the .mjo file, even if the test frequencies are not exactly those.

It is like dipping and loading a valve PA.
Set the power with 'q' and 'a'.
Hold down 'w' to cycle the iloc settings, watching band viewer.
When the minimum LO is found, do the same with 'e' for the qloc setting.
Repeat.
Use single presses to home in on the minimum LO value.
40-50dB should be possible.
Edit the settings into the .mjo file.
